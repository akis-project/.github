# Description

This project consists of several components, each being kept in their own repository.
These components are:

1. [akis-react-app](https://github.com/akis-project/akis-react-app)
2. [akis-nodejs-api](https://github.com/akis-project/akis-nodejs-api)
3. [akis-flask-api](https://github.com/akis-project/akis-flask-api)
4. [docker-compose](https://github.com/akis-project/docker-compose)
5. akis-mongo
6. **[akis-proxy ](https://github.com/akis-project/akis-proxy)(only in production environment)**

## General structure

The head component is

- **`docker-compose`** üß†
  - Stores config files
  - Manages services
  - Manages volumes
  - Manages networks
  - Manages environment variables

There are two versions of it:

- `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` for local development
  Since we don't have a different standalone instance for development, we use `dev` environment for local development purposes.

Both files will look as follows

Notice the difference that `prod` environment has an extra `akis-proxy` service.
It is not needed in local development ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Service definitions

- **`akis-react-app`**
  - Serves UI
  - Communicates with akis-nodejs-api
  - Runs on port 3000 (dev)
  - Runs on port 3001 (prod)
- **`akis-nodejs-api`**
  - Runs express server
  - Runs backend logic
  - Communicated with `akis-react-app`, `akis-flask-api`, and `mongo`
  - Hosts images statically to `akis-react-app`
  - Shares volume between `akis-flask-api`
  - Runs on port 5001 (always)
- **`akis-flask-api`**
  - Runs flask server
  - Runs machine learning model
  - Gets image from `akis-nodejs-api` and returns transcription results back.
  - Saves images and crops to local directory of host instance
  - Shares volume with `akis-nodejs-api`
  - Runs on port 5000 (always)
- **`mongo`**
  - Runs NoSQL database
  - Stores user information, transcription results and sessions.
  - Runs on port 27017
- **`akis-proxy`** (only in prod ‚ö†Ô∏è)
  - Proxy layer between `demos.sabanciuniv.edu` and host instance.
  - Receives requests from `demos.sabanciuniv.edu`
  - Forwards requests to host instance's `3001 `(react) and `5001 `(nodejs) ports
  - Runs on port 3000 (prod)

### Volume definitions

There are two local bind volumes:

```yml
db:
  driver: local
  driver_opts:
    type: "none"
    o: "bind"
    device: "../volumes/db"

uploads:
  driver: local
  driver_opts:
    type: "none"
    o: "bind"
    device: "../volumes/uploads"
```

- **`db`**
  - MongoDB's volume
  - Persistent (will remain even if you terminate services/containers)
- **`uplaods`**
  - Shared between flask and nodejs services
  - flask will save images in this directory
  - nodejs will read images from this directory

### Network definitions

Nothing fancy. Networks between services should be set `internal: true`
If you want to connect to MongoDB instance from public internet, set `internal: false`

```yml
react-nodejs-network:
  driver: bridge
  ipam:
    driver: default
    config:
      - subnet: 172.16.1.0/28

nodejs-mongo-network:
  driver: bridge
  internal: false # False to allow access from internet
  ipam:
    driver: default
    config:
      - subnet: 172.16.2.0/29

nodejs-flask-network:
  driver: bridge
  internal: false # False to allow access from internet
  ipam:
    driver: default
    config:
      - subnet: 172.16.3.0/29
```

# How to run the project locallyüíª

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the followings installed before you attempt to run the project in your computer:
| [Docker ](https://www.docker.com/)| 24.0.4, build 3713ee1 |
|--------|-----------------------|

- Note that the reason why docker is used in local development is because of volume bindings.

## Steps

1. Create a folder named `akis-project` somewhere in your disk.
2. Clone repositories from github
   - [akis-react-app](https://github.com/akis-project/akis-react-app)
   - [akis-nodejs-api](https://github.com/akis-project/akis-nodejs-api)
   - [akis-flask-api](https://github.com/akis-project/akis-flask-api)
   - [docker-compose](https://github.com/akis-project/docker-compose)
3. Switch to respective branches of each repository:

```sh
# akis-react-app
git switch dev

# akis-nodejs-api
git switch dev

# akis-flask-api
git switch dev

# docker-compose
# stay in 'main'
```

4. Create volumes in project directory (you must be in akis-project folder, at the root)

```sh
mkdir volumes
cd volumes
mkdir db
mkdir uploads
```

After this step, make sure you have the following folder structure:
![image](https://github.com/akis-project/.github/assets/68128434/7dff8b3f-41d1-42f7-8df6-52f644557494)

5. Change environment variables & run the docker compose

```sh
mv .env.dev .env
mv docker-compose.dev.yml docker-compose.yml

# To see logs:
docker compose up

# To run in detached mode:
# docker compose up -d
```

From now on, docker containers will be running on the background, with volumes and networks managed by itself automatically.
